# Statistical Comparison of Evaluation Results

This document explains how to run evaluations with statistical testing enabled, combine results across runs, and interpret the dashboard's comparison features.

## Overview

When comparing two or more models (or ablations), raw success rates can be misleading — small differences may be noise. The evaluation pipeline includes a **sequential statistical test** ([STEP](https://tri-ml.github.io/step/), Bonferroni-corrected) that determines whether observed differences are statistically significant. Results are summarized using **Compact Letter Display (CLD)**: models that do *not* share a letter are significantly different from each other.

## Workflow

### 1. Set your experimental budget

Before running any evaluations, decide the **maximum number of rollouts per model per task** you will ever collect. This is the `--max_sample_size` parameter. It configures the sequential test's stopping boundary and **must be set before seeing any results** to maintain statistical validity.

Choose this based on your compute budget. For example, if you plan to run at most 200 episodes per task per model:

```bash
--max_sample_size 200
```

### 2. Run evaluations

Run each model with the same `--max_sample_size` and the same `--output_dir`:

```bash
# Model A
uv run python vla_foundry/eval/run_evaluation.py $CHECKPOINT_A \
    --model_name model_a \
    --max_sample_size 200 \
    --num_episodes 0:200 \
    --output_dir rollouts

# Model B
uv run python vla_foundry/eval/run_evaluation.py $CHECKPOINT_B \
    --model_name model_b \
    --max_sample_size 200 \
    --num_episodes 0:200 \
    --output_dir rollouts
```
**Tip**: --num_episodes can be smaller than ```--max_sample_size```. For example, you might start with 100 episodes to get early results and collect more later (up to the budget) using the [incremental combining workflow](#combining-results-across-runs) described below.

### 3. View results in the dashboard

```bash
uv run --group dashboard python vla_foundry/eval/results_explorer.py rollouts/
```

Open `http://localhost:8505`. The **Model Comparison** tab shows:
- Beta posterior violin plots for each (task, model) pair
- CLD letter annotations (computed automatically if `max_sample_size` is available)
- An aggregate comparison across all tasks

Click **Refresh** to pick up new results as evaluations run. Statistical tests are re-computed on every refresh. Note that the first time STEP is invoked with a given --max_sample_size, it may take up to a few minutes to pre-compute decision rules and save them in small cache files. These are stored in the ```sequentialized_barnard_tests``` package. Subsequent runs reuse the cache, so statistical testing should be near-instant from the second invocation onward.

## Combining Results Across Runs

You can collect results incrementally. For example, run episodes 100-199 first, then 200-299 later:

```bash
# First batch
uv run python vla_foundry/eval/run_evaluation.py $CHECKPOINT \
    --model_name model_a --max_sample_size 200 --num_episodes 100:200 --output_dir rollouts

# Second batch (same model, same output dir, non-overlapping episodes)
uv run python vla_foundry/eval/run_evaluation.py $CHECKPOINT \
    --model_name model_a --max_sample_size 200 --num_episodes 200:300 --output_dir rollouts
```

This produces two timestamped `results.json` files under the same rollouts directory. The dashboard **automatically combines** them if:

1. **No overlapping episode indices** — each `(skill_type, scenario_index)` pair appears in only one file
2. **Same `max_sample_size`** — both runs were started with the same `--max_sample_size`

If these conditions aren't met, loading will fail with a `ValueError`. Remove stale results files before viewing — video recordings for older runs may have been overwritten.

## Metadata

Every `results.json` must contain a `max_sample_size_per_model` field recording the evaluation budget. This field should be written before any episodes complete so the budget is locked in from the start. Every results JSON is self-contained: it carries its own budget from the very first episode, and you can share just the JSON file for others to compare against.

### Why pre-commitment matters

The sequential STEP test provides valid statistical guarantees *only* when the maximum sample size is fixed before data collection begins. Changing it after seeing A/B testing results risks [data-dredging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging). Setting `--max_sample_size` at experiment launch time enforces this pre-commitment — the budget is decided before any results are observed.

## How Statistical Comparisons Work

We provide a brief technical overview of our statistical comparison framework. For motivation and details, see [this tech blog](https://medium.com/toyotaresearch/statistical-thinking-for-robot-policy-evaluation-from-rigorous-a-b-testing-to-effective-0ae886fbd68d).

### Per-task comparisons

For each task, the pipeline builds a boolean success/failure array per model and runs pairwise sequential tests ([`sequentialized_barnard_tests`](https://github.com/TRI-ML/sequentialized_barnard_tests)) between every pair of models. The test processes episodes sequentially and can reach a decision before consuming all data.

**Bonferroni correction** is applied across all pairwise comparisons to control the global false positive rate. With `K` models there are `K*(K-1)/2` pairs. The per-comparison significance level is:

```
alpha_per_pair = 0.05 / num_pairs
```

This ensures the probability of *any* false positive across all comparisons stays below 5%.

Each per-task test uses `n_max = max_sample_size_per_model` and processes episodes in their original order (`shuffle=False`), since outcomes within a single task are independent.

### Aggregate comparison

The aggregate comparison measures overall multi-task performance. It works by:

1. **Concatenating** each model's per-task boolean arrays into a single array across all tasks. For example, if a model has 50 episodes on task A and 50 on task B, its aggregate array has 100 entries.

2. **Shuffling** the concatenated array before running the test (`shuffle=True`). This is necessary because the concatenation interleaves results from different tasks, which may have different difficulty levels. Shuffling removes any ordering bias.

3. **Scaling the budget** proportionally: `n_max = max_sample_size_per_model * num_tasks`. If you budgeted 200 episodes per task and have 5 tasks, the aggregate test uses `n_max = 1000`.

4. **Running the same pairwise STEP test** with Bonferroni correction, identical to the per-task comparisons.

### Compact Letter Display (CLD)

Test results are summarized using [Compact Letter Display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_letter_display). Models are sorted by empirical success rate (highest first) and assigned letters:

- Models with entirely different letters **are** significantly different (with <=5% false positive rate)
- A model can have multiple letters (e.g., "ab") meaning it overlaps with both group "a" and group "b"
- Models that share a letter are **not** statistically separated from each other

If the test fails to decide (inconclusive — common when models have similar performance or sample sizes are small), those models will share a letter.

### Beta posterior visualization

The violin plots show **Bayesian beta posterior distributions** of each model's true success rate, computed independently of the sequential test:

- **Prior:** Beta(1, 1) (uniform)
- **Posterior:** Beta(1 + successes, 1 + failures)
- **Samples:** 2000 draws from the posterior per violin
- **Horizontal line:** posterior mean
- **Black dot:** empirical (observed) mean

These provide a visual sense of uncertainty. The CLD letters above each violin give the formal statistical conclusion.

## Using Released Evaluation Results

We release per-episode breakdown JSONs for some of our evaluation results. These were collected with a computational budget of **200 episodes per model per task** (`max_sample_size = 200`). When combining these with your own runs or running statistical comparisons against them, you **must** set `--max_sample_size 200` to match.

```bash
uv run python vla_foundry/eval/run_evaluation.py $YOUR_CHECKPOINT \
    --model_name your_model \
    --max_sample_size 200 \
    --num_episodes 0:200 \
    --output_dir rollouts
```

Place the released JSONs alongside your results in the same `rollouts/` directory structure and launch the dashboard. The combining and statistical comparison will work automatically as long as the budget is consistent.

## What the Dashboard Shows

### Summary Tab
- Success rate, confidence intervals, and rollout counts per (task, model) pair
- Color-coded by performance
